# Meta-Pseudo-Labels

The goal of this repository is to create an understandable and expandable PyTorch implementation of the Meta Pseudo Labels paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10580

This implementation is:
- correct (insofar as it is faithful to the paper)
- minimal
- readable
- easily runnable on cpu only hardware
